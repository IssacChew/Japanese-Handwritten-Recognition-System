# Japanese Handwritten Recognition System
Online recognition recognizes character patterns captured from a pen-based or touch-based data input device where trajectories of pen-tip or finger-tip movements are recorded and in this project, we will focus on Japanese language and build an Online Japanese Handwriting Character Recognition System.<br>

## Objectives
The project objectives of this project are:<br>
•	Build an online Japanese character handwriting recognition system.<br>
•	The system can recognize Japanese character accurately written by users.<br>
•	The system will be tested for its accuracy in recognizing Japanese Handwriting.<br>

## Requirements
Functional requirements:<br>
•	The system allow user to input Japanese Character from pen-based or touch-based input device.<br>
•	The system can process the input and display the outputs to user according to the confidence level of the input.<br>
•	The system can process the input and display the outputs instantly or no delay back to user.<br>

Non-functional requirements:<br>
•	The system can predict the input Japanese Character with high accuracy.<br> 
•	The interface of the system is user friendly and easy to use and understand to attract the attention and interest of user.<br>
